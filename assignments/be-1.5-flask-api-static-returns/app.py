Simple Flask API Static Returns
For this assignment, you will build a simple Flask API endpoint to return some static data.
[
		{
				"first_name":"John",
				"last_name":"Jonezz",
				"id":1,
				"city":"New York"
		},
		{
				"first_name":"Donna",
				"last_name":"Troy",
				"id":2,
				"city":"San Francisco"
		}
]
Create a list of dictionaries containing data for several users:
Create a simple flask application and make sure it runs without error (the terminal will inform of any errors)
Create an API endpoint /users/get that will return the list of users as a list of dictionaries.
Test the API endpoint using Postman. Verify that you receive the list of users as a JSON response
