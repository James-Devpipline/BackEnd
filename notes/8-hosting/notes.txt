000 means nobody has permission to access folder as its the same as -> 000000000
first 3 digits represents you
second 3 represents the group you're in 
third 3 is everyone else
order of group of three is read, write, execute
below is translating from num to binary, remember from left to write its 64,32,16,8,4,2,1
HOWEVER below its doing it each position, so from left to right its 4,2,1
700 -> 111000000 -> 4+2+1 = 7
760 -> 111110000
762 -> 111110010

444 = (r-- r-- r--): owner/group/others are all only able to read the file. They cannot write to it or execute it. 
644 = (rw- r-- r--): same as 444 except the owner can write to it. 
755 = (rwx r-x r-x): owner can read, write and execute the file, members in the user group and others can read and execute the file but cannot write to it. 

r = read, w = write and x = execute.
